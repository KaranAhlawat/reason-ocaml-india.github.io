            Purpose
          </h2>
          <p>
                Reason Bangalore (more correctly Bengaluru) is an inclusive
                community, commited to providing a safe, friendly and welcoming
                environment for all - regardless of age, gender, sexual
                orientation, ability, ethnicity, socio-economic status, and
                religion (or lack thereof).
              </p>

              <p>
                This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who
                participate in our community, as well as the consequences for
                unacceptable behavior. We invite all those who participate in
                Reason Bangalore to help us create safe and positive experiences
                for everyone.

                Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship
              </h2>
              <p>
                A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open
                source, culture &amp; tech citizenship by encouraging
                participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships
                between our actions and their effects on our community.
              </p>

              <p>
                Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and
                positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of
                inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
              </p>

              <p>
                If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our
                community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all
                participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to
                know.
