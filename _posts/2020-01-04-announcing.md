Hey,


Finally, Bengaluru finally gets it's own Reason/OCaml community. And
hopefully, the meetup serves as an excuse to meet, exchange ideas,
and hack on all things Reason/OCaml. 

<!--more-->

Reason Bangalore is an inclusive, beginner friendly and motivated
individuals, looking to help each with Reason/OCaml. It is important
that we follow certain guidelines to ensure that community provides a
safe and nuturing space for everyone. We encourage everyone to
familiarise themselves with the expected [Code of
Conduct](/code-of-conduct.html)

We hope Reason Bangalore provides a great platform to discuss type
safety, ecosystem shortcomings, tooling, proposed solutions, FP
influenced software practises (UI, reproducible builds, abstractions
etc) and all things FP that can help us practise writing robust
software. At the same time, we need to be mindful of newcomers and
ensures everyone feels welcome :)

Cheers!
