In our latest meeting, familiar faces returned, showing sustained interest since our group's inception. Attendees, experienced in OCaml or eager to learn, dedicated their Sunday afternoon to engage with us. We agreed to meet weekly online to write OCaml together, enhancing our community ties. Discussions also covered potential venues in Bangalore for in-person gatherings. Our focus was on functional programming, specifically OCaml. For a deeper dive into the topics discussed, visit [Manas Jayanth's Slides](https://slides.manas-jayanth.com/org/reason-bangalore-introduction-to-functional-programming/). Join us next time as we continue exploring and building our community through collaboration and coding.
