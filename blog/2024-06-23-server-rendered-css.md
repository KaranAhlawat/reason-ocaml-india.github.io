We continued the development of our [Dream](https://aantron.github.io/dream/) powered Server Side rendered React components (without node.js) with [styled-ppx](https://styled-ppx.vercel.app/)

### `styled-ppx` working only on Client side

[Commit](https://github.com/ReasonOCamlIndia/dream-web-server-sessions/commit/8b334495768f6beed22d6002a51a297b07dbf032)

We used Melange compiler to compile Reason to JS, which is fed to webpack.

### Making sure it works on server side.

[Commit](https://github.com/ReasonOCamlIndia/dream-web-server-sessions/commit/0dc5e22a62d16460d89c03031d1b1ac509f11a23)

We use `CssJs.render_style_tag()` to generated server side rendered CSS to inject into the `style` tag.

### Dynamic CSS props

[Commit](https://github.com/ReasonOCamlIndia/dream-web-server-sessions/commit/7fe9493cd01d2dc5d0f79cada3ec486d70c7623f)

This was uncharted territory. Thankfully, [@davesnx](https://x.com/davesnx) had given a heads-up! The CSS rendering, `render_style_tag` must be called only after React components are rendered. 

Join us on Discord if you'd like to learn more about this.
