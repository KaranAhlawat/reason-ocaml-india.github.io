title: "Meetup 10: Router for server rendered React components without Node.js - part 1"
authors: [prometheansacrifice]
---

We continued the development of our [Dream](https://aantron.github.io/dream/) powered Server Side rendered React components (without node.js) with [routes](https://github.com/anuragsoni/routes). This meet-up, it was client side only. In a future meetup, we plan to make the router work with both server and client.

There was interesting discussion on SIMD/Vector programming and Mirage OS distribution that doesn't use libc.


## Next Meetup
We will be continuing the Canvas tutorial, led by AC Sreedhar. More details [here](/upcoming-meetups#continued-html-canvas-game-tutorial-but-with-reason-and-ocaml)
