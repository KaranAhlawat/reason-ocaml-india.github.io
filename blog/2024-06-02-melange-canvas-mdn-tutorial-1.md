The most interactive meetup in while! 30 minutes past the set meetup time, and discussions still did not end. We had to take it over to a Discord voice channel.

We had a very interesting mix of hobbyist OCamlers, static analysis engineers and newcomers discussing what OCaml is and how it compares to Java, Scala and others. As an organiser, I usually set aside 15-20 minutes, before and after the planned discussions, for free-form discussions. This one happened to be the most lively one. We shared important links on this [Discord thread](https://discord.com/channels/697427834594918470/1246744023302012948)

We, then, proceeded to live-code the HTML5 Canvas game tutorial on Mozilla Developer Network but with Reason. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/ReasonOCamlIndia/melange-mdn-canvas-game-tutorial-live-coded).

## Next Meetup

We couldn't cover the entire tutorial. So, it will be continued by AC Sreedhar in a future meetup. More details [here](/upcoming-meetups#continued-html-canvas-game-tutorial-but-with-reason-and-ocaml)

Next weekend, we'll be discussing Nikhil Bijapur's Monopoly Deal, a card game. We plan to learn how this game was built with OCaml and live-code with him. Details can be found [here](/upcoming-meetups#live-coding-monopoly-deal-written-in-ocaml)
