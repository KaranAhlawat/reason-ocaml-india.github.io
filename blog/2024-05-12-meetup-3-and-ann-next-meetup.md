title: "Meetup 3: How ocaml.org is built with Dream"

[Shakthi Kannan](https://twitter.com/shaktimaan) introduced us to how
[ocaml.org](https://ocaml.org) website is built. He showed us the
tools needed to get started, and the commands to build and run the
website.

We had a casual round of discussion about embedded systems as some of
the attendees write embedded software for a living. Of course,
[mirage.io](https://mirage.io) came up!


## Next meetup: May 19th, 2pm.

We continue where we left off last weekend. You can find the code
repository on [Github
org](https://github.com/ReasonIndia/dream-web-server-sessions). You
can reach out me on X at
[@ManasJayanth](https://twitter.com/ManasJayanth) if you have any
trouble. I recommend you set it up and install the dependencies to
save time during the call :)

Setting up OCaml and Reason tools isn't easy for everyone. Please reach
out to us on Discord if you're lost setting up the tools.
