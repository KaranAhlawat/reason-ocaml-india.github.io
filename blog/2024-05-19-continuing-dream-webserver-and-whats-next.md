I led the session today. We managed to,

1. We'll be replace the hello world html printing router in from [the last session on Dream](https://reason-bangalore.org/blog/meetup-2-and-ann-next-meetup), with a server side rendered Hello World react component.
2. Replace the hello world component with a simple click counter
3. Setup frontend stack: the react component in the previous step will be compiled to JS with Melange and bundled with Webpack.
4. See React component hydration at work from a natively compiled website that rendered the react component

We were joined by organisers of two other communities, [Anupam](https://functional.cafe/@haskman) from [Functional Programming, India](https://x.com/functionalindia) and svs from [The Engineering Org](https://discord.gg/7HngyZWuJq)


## Next meetup: May 26th, 2pm.

We learn how Melange compiler works with a build system to generate JS artifacts. We see how [webpack-reason-loader](https://github.com/DiningPhilosophersCo/reason-loader) was built and try to integrate it with this website [here](/mdn-game-tutorial)
 You can find the code repository on [Github org](https://github.com/ReasonIndia/reason-ocaml-india.github.io). You
can reach out me on X at [@ManasJayanth](https://x.com/ManasJayanth) if you have any trouble. I recommend you set it up and install the dependencies to save time during the call :)

Please reach out to us on Discord if you're lost setting up the tools.
