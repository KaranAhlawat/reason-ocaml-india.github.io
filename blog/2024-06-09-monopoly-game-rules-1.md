title: "Meetup 7: Building a Monopoly Deal Clone"
authors: [theteachr]

We discussed encoding the rules of the popular card game Monopoly Deal in
OCaml's type system with @theteachr.

**Highlights**

- Briefly discussed the gameplay.
- Incrementally built modules around relevant data structures.
- Explored whether constructors could clash.
  - Initially, the general understanding was that it wouldn't work. Either the
	compilation would fail, or one of them would not be usable. But found out
	that it will just need some extra [type] hinting on some occasions to get
	the correct type.
- Focussed on the principal of _making invalid states impossible to represent_.
- Created an incomplete game state just to start getting some feedback.
