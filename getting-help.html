        <h1> Getting help </h1>
	<p> Learning a new language is easier when done socially. We
  all have different ways of learning - documentation serves as a
  great reference material, but having another person help us
	  understand it always helps. We recommend the following
  channels to ask for help. </p>

            Discord community
          </h2>

	  <p> <a href="https://discord.gg/f8eYkxw">link</a> </p>
          <p>
	    By far the most helpful and talent folks hang out
	    there. Discord communities organise themselves as smaller channels
	    in a larger server. The invite link gets you access to ReasonML
	    Discord servers. Feel free to join a server and post a question on
	    #general - post on Reason servers are ephemeral and not indexed by
	    search engines so that beginners feel more comfortable asking
	    questions. Bonus credits, however, for posting relevant questions on their
	    respective channels :)

	  <h2>Forums</h2>
	  <p>Forums can sometimes be more convenient - they encourage
	    long form content. Post authors, both the posting the question or
	    answer, can take more time to prepare the content. Also,
	    these posts are indexed by search engines - so you'll be doing
	    fellow new comers, such as yourself, too.</p>

	    <h3> OCaml Discuss </h3>
	    <p><a href="https://discuss.ocaml.org/">link</a></p>
	    <p> While the forum doesn't discourage ReasonML in any
	      form, we recommend you post things that questions more relevant to the
	      OCaml toolchain or the ecosystem. Some of more informative and
	      educational moments can be experienced simply by going through the
	      archives here. Experienced OCaml folks, who help newcomers on Reason
	      servers too, share many interesting insights. </p>
